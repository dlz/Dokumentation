George Herbert Mead : interactionist tradition. identifies the "I" and the "me" as two phases of an internal conversation.
interconnectedness of mind, self and society.
the mind is a product of its social environment and we develop our personalities through internalizing social processes such as interaction and communication.
the "me" in that it involves taking the view of the other towards oneself as a social object

challenge to psychoanalytic and sociobiological theories : human nature as existing innately and independently of the social world.
"mentalistic" approach : the mind is socially shaped ans emerges as a product of the social process.
we create mental representations of other people and objects, including "society".

Durkheim : collective representations that shap the way individuals think and feel.

William James : 
distinguishes between the empirical self, which can be observed by others, and the social self, as a collection of feelings about who "I" am and what is "mine".
the "phase of I" that form the nucleus of the social self.
people use the word "I" in conversation to express different "self-feelings", such as desires, declarations and ambitions.
language often has a performative element, as we can use statements about how we think, feel or perceive things as a way of displaying identity to others.
it is impossible to think of oneself without also thinking of other people or objects in the world and differentiating ourselves from them, we define ourselves relationally.
there is no sense of "I" without its correlative sense of you or he or they.
the social self therefore represents a collection of thoughts and feelings about oneself - self sentiments - that emerge from the communicative life of society.

Herbert Spencer : the societies were like biological organisms appealing to his interest in the "mechanics" of evolution.

"symbolic interactionism"
looking-glass self : an image of oneself from the perspectiv of other people.
3 elements : the imagination of our appearance to another person
the imagination of his or her judgement of that appearance
the resultant self-feelings, such as pride, shame or mortification
the way in which we think about ourselves is based not on an objective, mechanical image of "me", but on these imputed sentiments which others seem to have of us
we can have many different social selves, as the looking glasses that different audiences in different situations hold up to us will reveal a wide rande og images

Social Organization 1909 : the relationship between larger, formal organizations and the smaller groups of which they are composed.
