George Herbert Mead : interactionist tradition. identifies the "I" and the "me" as two phases of an internal conversation.
interconnectedness of mind, self and society.
the mind is a product of its social environment and we develop our personalities through internalizing social processes such as interaction and communication.

challenge to psychoanalytic and sociobiological theories : human nature as existing innately and independently of the social world.
"mentalistic" approach : the mind is socially shaped ans emerges as a product of the social process.
we create mental representations of other people and objects, including "society".

Durkheim : collective representations that shap the way individuals think and feel.

William James : 
distinguishes between the empirical self, which can be observed by others, and the social self, as a collection of feelings about who "I" am and what is "mine".
the "phase of I" that form the nucleus of the social self.
people use the word "I" in conversation to express different "self-feelings", such as desires, declarations and ambitions.
language often has a performative element, as we can use statements about how we think, feel or perceive things as a way of displaying identity to others.
it is impossible to think of oneself without also thinking of other people or objects in the world and differentiating ourselves from them, we define ourselves relationally.
there is no sense of "I" without its correlative sense of you or he or they.
the social self therefore represents a collection of thoughts and feelings about oneself - self sentiments - that emerge from the communicative life of society.
